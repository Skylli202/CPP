# Skyfus app

This is a small application written in C++ to ease the gameplay of a multiples simultanous dofus account.  
Allowing a similar `Alt + Escape` / `Alt + Shift + Escape` behavior but bound to the registered dofus client.  

> This application only works for Windows. POSIX system are not supported.

The latest release (v1.0.0) has been tested and work on Dofus Retro `v1.41.9`.  
It has been tested on Windows 11 and 10. But as this application is based upon the `win32.dll` it should work on older version of Windows without any issue.
